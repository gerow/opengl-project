-What we did.  Solar system.
 -Inspiration.  Sort of last minute thing.  We had a lot of backend stuff written but just needed it to do something specific.
 
-Design.  We chose to use java and JOGL.  We also wrote it to be relatively modular, mostly because we weren't sure what exactly we wanted to do.
 -Have ability to load meshes from obj files and mtl files.  Also can load custom shaders to be applied to meshes.
 -Also have ability to create particles clouds.
 
-Gerow did a lot of the backend stuff, creating nice classes so we could interact with gl at a higher level.  Gendotti put the
particle system together.  Gumport and Eisel worked mainly on putting the actual solar system together given these things.

-Challenges
 -Ran into performance issues.  The system was not quite efficient as we thought.  Tried to work around them, but you will see
 that they are still evident in the final version.
 
 -If we were to do it again we would have been more careful about performance to begin with.
 	-Initially the way we draw an individual polygon was very inefficient.  Note difference between uniforms and attributes at a mesh level.
 	-Also would have used VBOs.
