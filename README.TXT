To run:

Import the code as a project in Eclipse and make sure to add the gluegen.jar gluegen-rt.jar and jogl.all.jar to the classpath.  Then compile and run glproject.scenes.SolarSystem.

Sorry I couldn't be more specific, I forgot to do this until the last moment.  If you are having trouble getting it to run I can provide more details after the submission time.
